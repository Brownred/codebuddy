# codebuddy

This extension for Visual Studio Code provides a generative AI assistant that can help generate code, complete tasks, and assist you in your development workflow. The assistant is powered by a machine learning model that can understand and respond to natural language input, allowing you to interact with it as you would with a human assistant.

## Features

- Code generation: The assistant can generate code snippets based on your input, allowing you to quickly create code without having to write it all yourself.
- Task completion: The assistant can help you complete tasks such as debugging, testing, and refactoring, making your development workflow more efficient.
- Code refactoring: The assistant can refactor your code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
- Code analysis: The assistant can analyze your code and provide suggestions for improvement, such as pointing out potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
- Code formatting: The assistant can format your code to conform to your preferred style guide, making your code more readable and maintainable.
- Code search: The assistant can search for code snippets and functions within your codebase, allowing you to quickly find and reuse existing code.
